# Seam
[![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/Rarst/seam/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/Rarst/seam/?branch=master)

Seam is a lightweight site renderer for [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) content and [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templates. There isn’t nearly enough “managing” going on to call it CMS, but one prone to hyperbole could.

It is mostly writing [Pico](http://picocms.org/) from scratch and differently. Powered by [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/), [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), [pjax](http://pjax.heroku.com/), and other buzzwords.

There are a lot of previously invented wheels like it. But this one is mine. 

# How to

[Composer in WordPress](http://composer.rarst.net) is the one and only site this was made for. Looking at [source](https://github.com/Rarst/composer-in-wp) might or might not be helpful.

Why would you even want to use this? Move along.
