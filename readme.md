# Description

Seam is lightweight site renderer for [Markdown](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/) content and [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templates. There isn't nearly enough "managing" going on to call it CMS, but one prone to hyperbole could.

It is mostly writing [Pico](http://pico.dev7studios.com/) from scratch and differently. Powered by [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/), [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), [pjax](http://pjax.heroku.com/) and other buzzwords.

There are a lot of previously invented wheels like it. But this one is mine. 

# How to

[Composer in WordPress](http://composer.rarst.net) is the one and only site this was made for. Looking at [source](https://bitbucket.org/Rarst/cwp) might or might not be helpful.

Why would you even want to use this? Move along.
